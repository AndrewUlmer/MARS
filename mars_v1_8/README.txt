Instruction to set up launchers:

change the absolute path  where the MARS_V1_8 folder is in the following .desktop and .sh files:
-MARS.desktop and MARS.sh
-MARS_rename_version_utility.desktop
-MARS_dump_bento_dir.desktop

Be sure that in MARS.sh the export path to the where CUDA is installed is correct. You can find it usually in /home/$USER/.bashrc
